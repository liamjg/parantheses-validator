# parantheses-validator
This JS function is intended to validate parantheses and will return true if all parantheses in the input string are 'closed' or false if they are not.
This particular branch is intended to validate LISP code and, as such, includes extra function to make sure it ignores parantheses in strings and comments.

... this is not a very good solution, but it passes the included test cases
